We will create a random number between one and twenty and based on the results of the random
number, we will check to see if the number falls within certain ranges.
If the number is greater than 15, the result will be "Cherries".
If the number is greater than 10, the result will be "Orange".
If the number is greater than 5, the result will be "Plum".
If the number is greater than 2, the result will be "Melon".
If the number is greater than 1, the result will be "Bell".
If the number is not any of the above, than the result will be "Bar".

We loop three times and print the results to the user.
